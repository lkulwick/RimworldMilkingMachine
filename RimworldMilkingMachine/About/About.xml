Adds an automated milk extractor pad with internal storage and a refuel‑style UI. Milkable colony animals head to the pad when nearly full, complete a short session, and their milk is stored up to capacity (overflow drops near the pad). Colonists can perform a Basic work job to empty the extractor on demand or automatically when a configurable map‑wide threshold is reached. No Harmony patches required.
