[h1]Rimworld Milking Machine[/h1]

Automate dairy chores with a self-service extractor pad. Milkable colony animals seek the pad once they are full, lie down for a short session, and the machine deposits their milk beside the building without pawns needing a milking work order.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*] Automated milk extractor pad unlocked via the new [i]Automated milking systems[/i] research.
[*] Internal storage with capacity; overflow drops near the pad. Full pads block animal use until emptied. Silver-lined reservoirs preserve milk indefinitely.
[*] Emptying job (Basic work): colonists dump stored milk onto the ground; right-click to prioritize. No Harmony patches used.
[*] Refuel-style gizmo with white bar: shows X/Y milk and a vertical auto-empty marker; drag the bar to set the map-wide threshold.
[*] Variants: standard (3x1, 75 cap), heavy (3x2, 300 cap), advanced (2× faster), and advanced heavy (2× faster, 300 cap).
[*] Forbid-aware: forbidden pads are ignored by animals and colonists (unless forced).
[*] Dev tool: "Fill milk fullness" to quickly test behavior.

[h2]How to Use[/h2]
[olist]
[*] Research [i]Automated milking systems[/i].
[*] Build the milk extractor pad from the Production tab (small: ~30W idle / ~60W in use; heavy: ~60W idle / ~100W in use).
[*] Keep milkable animals assigned to your colony; they will head to the pad when nearly full.

[h2]Compatibility & Notes[/h2]
[list]
[*] Designed for RimWorld 1.6.
[*] No Harmony dependency. The mod does not patch vanilla methods.
[*] Debug logs prefixed with "RMM" help trace animal decisions (dev mode).
