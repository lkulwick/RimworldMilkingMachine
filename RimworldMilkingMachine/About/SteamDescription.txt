[h1]Rimworld Milking Machine[/h1]

Automate dairy chores with a self-service extractor pad. Milkable colony animals seek the pad once they are full, lie down for a short session, and the machine deposits their milk beside the building without pawns needing a milking work order.

[list]
[*] Automated milk extractor pad unlocked via the new [i]Automated milking systems[/i] research.
[*] Animals reserve the pad and release milk automatically; colonists stand down.
[*] Debug action "Fill milk fullness" helps troubleshoot or showcase the setup.
